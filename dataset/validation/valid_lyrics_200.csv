The animals would hide behind the rocks
Except the little fish
When they told me east is west
As they tried to cry

And, oh, what a wreck you've made me

Are you there over the ocean?
Are you there up in the sky?
Until the return of my love

My hope is on the horizon
Every face, your eyes I can see
I plead and I pray through each night and day
Our embrace is only a dream

Each hour becomes a life's time
When she'd left I'd only begun

Taken out of my sight

Evolution came with lessons learned

Calculate your intuition

For you do not understand

Awake, angels of lunacy,
Arise, avatars of chaos,
Incinerate yourselves,
In the blaze of Babylon,
Hierophants of the Hurricane,
We invoke the Eidolon.

Unleash the storm...

We renounce the sin,
Of mortal fallacy,
Bestow upon us,
Our stellar legacy.

Peel the benighted shells,
From our radiant cores,
We obey the laws,
Of finitude no more.

Ascend...
In Akasha to Procreate.
Strip the flesh from your soul,
Extend...
Open the Silver Gate...
Melt yourself beyond all control.

Give birth to the vision,
Let enter the voice,
And dare not falter,
Lest the demons eat you.
Confide in your Nuit,
Never your senses.

Nine apparitions,
The nails of Yod,
Drip from the moon
As unhallowed blood,
Anubis' terror to feed you,
As the night condenses.

Ascend...
In Akasha to Procreate.
Strip the flesh from your soul,
Extend...
Open the Silver Gate...
Melt yourself beyond all control.

In poisoned aberration,
Tarnished minion abide,
Convocating execrations,
To drown and smother, to divide.

Recline, Rejoice,
Discard the body,
And savour this, your threnody,
Divine by lust alone,
And second skin,
As the eyes turn to stone,
Let the heave begin!

Azazel!
Shemhazai!
Rejoin your kin in faith and fate!

Heed not the warnings,
We invoke the manyfold
Ny-Ar-Rut-Hotep
For we know,
There is no peace at the gate,
There is no peace at the gate...

Ascend,
In Akasha to procreate,
Strip the flesh from your soul,
Extend, open the Silver Gate,
Melt yourself beyond all control,
In Akasha to procreate,
Disembodied, unfettered souls,
Open the Silver Gate,
We embrace the stars
With twin black holes",sad

I wanna tell you a little story about a party in this song...

It happened back in '93, in the PITTSBURG PUNK ROCK SCENE
An event that will go down, in infamy
It was all the masterplan, of one legendary PUNK ROCK KID
His name was ""Spaz"", S-P-A-Z

An eviction notice to his house sparked off an idea
""I should have one last party at my place...""
So off he set with his master plan, the invitation in his hand read:
""You're invited to my House Destruction Party!""

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

LET'S GO!

We played there St. Patrick's Day with Submachine and THE BAD GENES
In a basement full of debris
From kicked in doors, broken glass, knocked in walls, THE PLACE WAS THRASHED
The house was now missing it's support beams

The bathrooms had no toilets or sinks left in them
There was nothing in the kitchen left to break
Aus Rotten spray painted on the walls, drunk punks passed out in the halls
And this was just the second night of the three-day long party

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

The cops showed up and all the kids went piling out the back
I remember running away and hiding out in the lot behind the Squirrel Hill Mellon Bank
The cop said, ""I wanna speak to someone who lives here!"" and this punk kid said she did
He asked, ""Is this the condition the house has always been in?""
She answered, ""Uh... yeah, it is.""

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

As they all watched in anticipation
The crowd must have longed for
Their own rendezvous

It don't matter cuz I'm underground anyway
Rich balling, bitch call and fly any day
You dirty niggas y'all too whack to dance
Y'all need to ease up off that now before y'all splint y'all pants
And leave that up to my niggas, young fly niggas
Getting down you and I niggas dont try niggas

On who gonna invite the hoes that make the party valid
Cuz we don't need a whole crib full of dudes again
And here come the police with them big black boots again
Kicking niggas out
Hand cuffing and stuffing they banging jacky chicken in they mouth
And time to shine pitching a fit
Cuz somebody rolled her bud in a heeny blunt and won't pass the shit

Why the music keep skipping?
And why these dirty khaki niggas tripping?

Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone, fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully 
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me 
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. , I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty 
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet  in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' 
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song """" has gotten such rotten responses.""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me 
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit, too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on   and the heroin
Where were the parents at and look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin')
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way 
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on """"

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience 
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions 
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out 
'Cause they drivin' me crazy 
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am

You've got false apostles teaching lies perverting the only way

I walked to the fertile crescent and built
the sphinx
I designed a pyramid so tough that a star
that only glows every one hundred years falls
into the center giving divine perfect light
I am bad

I sat on the throne
drinking nectar with allah
I got hot and sent an ice age to europe
to cool my thirst
My oldest daughter is nefertiti
the tears from my birth pains
created the nile
I am a beautiful woman

I gazed on the forest and burned
out the sahara desert
with a packet of goat's meat
and a change of clothes
I crossed it in two hours
I am a gazelle so swift
so swift you can't catch me

For a birthday present when he was three
I gave my son hannibal an elephant
He gave me rome for mother's day
My strength flows ever on

My son noah built new/ark and
I stood proudly at the helm
as we sailed on a soft summer day
I turned myself into myself and was
jesus
men intone my loving name
All praises All praises
I am the one who would save

I sowed diamonds in my back yard
My bowels deliver uranium
the filings from my fingernails are
semi-precious jewels
On a trip north
I caught a cold and blew
My nose giving oil to the arab world
I am so hip even my errors are correct
I sailed west to reach east and had to round off
the earth as I went
The hair from my head thinned and gold was laid
across three continents

I am so perfect so divine so ethereal so surreal
I cannot be comprehended except by my permission

I mean...I...can fly
like a bird in the sky...",sad

Getting ready for another year like this

Another year to lie
Another year goes by

Is it me on how I see
The face of mediocrity
I try to smile you see
Your lightness darkens me
Filter all of your emotions
Fake you're never low
Or face the one you fear
You're living through another year

Another year to lie
Another year goes by
Another year to lie
Another year goes by",sad

You might not like my style
But we've been hanging around this town
Just a little too long a while 
You say you're gonna get your act together
Gonna take it out on the road
But if I dont get outta here pretty soon
My head's going to explode 

Sure I like country music
I like mandolins
But right now I need a telecaster
Through a vibro-lux turned up to ten 

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl 

I need a little shot of that rhythm baby
Mixed up with these country blues
I wanna trade in these ol country boots
For some fine italian shoes 

Forget the mousse and the hairspray sugar
We dont need none of that
Just a little dab'll do ya girl
Underneath a pork pie hat 

Until hell freezes over
Maybe you can wait that long
But I dont think Ronnie Milsap's gonna ever
Record this song 

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl 

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl 

Maybe there's nothin' happenin' there
Maybe there's somethin' in the air
Before our upper lips get stiff
Maybe we need us a big ol whiff 

If we could just get off-a that beat little girl
Maybe we could find the groove
At least we can get a decent meal
Down at the Rendez-vous 

'Cause one more heartfelt steel guitar chord
Girl, it's gonna do me in
I need to hear some trumpet and saxophone
You know sound as sweet as sin 

And after we get good and greasy
Baby we can come back home
Put the cowhorns back on the cadillac
And change the message on the cord-a-phone 

But... 

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl",happy

I'm gone 
Up up up and away
And I'm on
A higher plane 
With a brain
With a flame 
Feel the fire
Desire the same
Knowledge and wisdom
And understanding
Possessed by gods
Transferred to man in
A script of a book
A scripture that looks 
Like a Biblical writing
Inviting a hook
Of a song sing along with a strong
Subliminal
Message divesting all men from 
Criminal
Acts of the Devil
Revealed and reveled
Designed to recline the mind to lower level
With no spiritual level
Read the Holy Koran
Or the Bible
Because it's liable
To be a revival
For the weak who seek power it'll bring
Infallible power 
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
Who wants some
come get it
A battle is a test of wits 
And I'm witted
Hard beats a torch
And I lit it
Stop the music
Alright hit it
Now that it feels good
I'm heating up
I feed off knowledge
And can't get enough
Knowledge is infinite
Suckers ain't into it
Ignorance is bliss
And they're kin to it
Party and dance
And don't ever glance
At a book or look
For their mind to advance
Caught in a rut
Chasing butt
Trying to get a dollar
Or trying to get a nut
Evil feeds 
Off a source of apathy
Weak in the mind
And of course you have to be
Less than a man
More like a thing
No knowledge you're nothin'
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
My rhymes make
A meak mind anorexic
You can't hang without slang
So eject it
I've selected
Rhymes for records
To affect the effect
Of the rhyme that left
Hangin' like a pound
That came down
But you're hangin' the brain
So your brain's hell-bound
Lost and found
By the serpent's sound
What you don't know
Can't hurt that's profound
Or absurd
A better word
An ingnorant fool
Is a real cool nerd
Pockets are fat
With an empty head
Got a little fame and a name
And you're brain dead
You count dollars
So ya think ya in
What good is knowing how to count
If you don't know when
And history today
And it will equal the future
Repetitive mistakes
Cause the brain ain't acute ya
Need knowledge
To understand
The concept of sacrifice
But man don't understand
So we have to fight
War
Killing people we never 
Saw before
Most don't eden know
What they're killin' for
Following rulers
Instead of the prophets
The wicked can rule ya
But the knowledge can stop it
Souls can't be controlled
It's a spiritual thing
But you got the knowledge
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
My knowledge comes
From a spiritual force
Stonger than any
Earthly source
Propaganda
Hype or slander
I won't believe the hype
I understand the
Media dictates
The mind and rotates
The way you think
And syncopates slow pace
Brains
Can't maintain
Acertain
Insipid inane crass rain
Insane lame
Traditions 
All praise fame
Positions
Want to be a star
Drive a big car 
Live bourgeios
Ane won't know who you are
Lost in the source
And praising the dollar
Whether your faith is
Christ or Allah
The knowledge of God 
Will teach one thing
The dollar is moot

Eleven years later we shared crop wit Geffen
In musical hell, but hip-hop forever heaven

Swollen wit minds that got stolen

Out of sync, outta order like a puzzle
In the land of the unseen hand that hold juggle
In a Game of Life, yo it's hard to roll a double
Tryin times, take lives and separate couples
Kids thinkin they grown, tellin they moms ""Fuck you""
Under they breath, livin in the last times left

Four-four the corridor, seal it, no floor
But I could see the drop was a mile aboard

Johnnie politely her ass behind the back three

What we gon' do, it's all upon you
What I say, what it do?
Do - no not you, you know I got to
And if you got me, then I got you

Ain't it mayne, turn the lights off
Hit the right spot (oooh)

But it can't happen if you ain't real
Don't, you, play with me
Come and spend, the day with me
Everything is everything

Who's the dopest of 'em all
Gots to be Big Snoop Dogg
So pick up the phone and answer my call

(Chorus - 2X)

How, long, has it been
Since you had that thang up in
They say Dogg you walk it too much
And you may think I'm talkin too much
But then again I reminisce
I miss that hug, I miss that kiss
I miss that love
Really 'cause, I miss that bitch

And I love it when you hit that switch
Shorty tell me how you get that thick
Where the f**k did you get that fit
Come and fire the 'dro up let me hit that shit
That's right - had a nigga feelin so good
That when I had went home
I was thinkin 'bout you so hard
that I couldn't help but to pick up the phone

(Outro)
And I just had to call ya
I'm lovin how you look and how you smell
And you got a ass fat as hell
I just had to call ya
Girl I'm lovin what you do to me
You break me off and then put me to sleep
I just had to call ya
I got a couple things that we can do
Just let me know if I can come through

When the war is over we would be free
He said that we'd have to drive
Those Nazis back to Germany
His vote in the post-war years
Was a steadfast cast for FDR
'Cause he thought that the new deal
Would heal a nation's bleeding heart 
A man in his middle years
Shed tears about the economy
He said that the balance of the deficity
Would set us free
He was caught in a fragile state
Cause the Dow had never sunk this far
So he searched for the deliverance
At the bottom of a bottle at a local bar

CHANNEL
Everybody, Everybody wants to be free
But I'm here to tell you

CHORUS
Freedom
Can only be found in the blood of Jesus
Freedom
Can only be known in the love of God
Freedom
Comes to whoever would dare to believe Jesus is
Freedom

A child once spoke of the hour
When school would end and he could play
His freedom waited for him
At the ending of another day
His dream was to get to his home
For a stickball challenge on the avenue
If he could get past the dealer
Selling dope
In the middle of the hall at the grammar school

Then you are gone without a trace

I sit alone and wonder why
Sometimes it's hard but I will try
To live my life without you

You're in my heart, and in my dreams
You're everywhere or so it seems
So many times I've heard that song
Hold back the tears and tell you're strong 

Another day goes slowly by
I sit alone and wonder why
I think of you and start to cry
Nothing's the same without you

Another time, another place
The sweetness of our last embrace
What would I give to see your face
Nothing's the same without you

But one thing remains the same till the end of time
I think I'll remain, I think I'll just stay...

A b-boy standin in my b-boy stance

From the top of the highest summit, again we run it. 
A hundred and forty four shimmering lights stunnin 
Too quick for the human eye to catch a glimpse 
You know pimps cannot convince with bigger attempts of emcee'in, 
Blowing words in the wind, 
While we ascend to limitless ends and pretend 
We're still human, when if fact we're only half
the other path extends infinity do the max
I try to laugh, but they pull me down like crabs in a bucket 
With hands in my pocket, how long will it last?
Heaven only knows, so Kheaven keeps inventing the flows
That turns black prose to white foes
Your just supposin have you heard my words
moving at light speed and getting blurred.
It's all so incredible decibles at glance standing in a b-stance 

A B-boy standin in my B-boy stance

This one leads the way… 
Now cut it up, cut it up back to back, on the wheels of steel, cut it up back to back 

Elevate, Meditate, eliminate
thoughts from my past keep knocking upon my gate 
Shouldn't let em in, the answers not to debate 
But to observe the debating and then we can all escape

Yo party people listen up at the drop of the dime, 
They took cameras to africa for pictures to rhyme 
Over oh.. yes, the great pretenders 
Religious entertainers who want to be life savers 
Damn.. another dollar for the mind, another cold ??? hoping 
They can't find, they can't copy or get pictures with no lines, 
I guess it's just a case of the blind leading the blind 
But, I'm flippin and steppin and rockin the roll,
Taking control, payin my tolls, losing control
I'm playin a role so people will remember that 
I'm just a servant of rap, hopin to bring it back 

Im a B-boy standin in my B-boy stance

This one leads the way… break

From a valley unseen
Out of the depths of a trembling heart
You find yourself starting to sing

Listen to your own words

Let the chorus build louder and louder
And shatter the blackness and pain
Let it rise like a healing flame

Sing your freedom, freedom, freedom

I'm so lyrically potent and I'm flowin' and explodin'

On the scene mean I got the potential
To make you go then chill
I got the credentials that is of which I chose
To make a rhyme and chill then you know

I will fulfill to make a couple of mill
As I build a guild for all the rappers and skills
And kill the weak rappers and no thrills
Hang 'em an ephigy if he's a sucker

Hang 'em to the left of me 'cause my right hand man
Is my mic stand and the microphone that I own
And my game plan is keeping at a steady pace
Ain't no need for a rush it ain't no race

I'ma hit the top just when I wanna
And it's a matter of time and I'm gonna
'Cause I know when to go 'head enter
The classic Moe Dee rap that sent ya

Runnin' around holdin' ya head
Askin' ya homeboy yo man
You hear what he said another funky rhythm
Look at ya man and give him a high five

'Cause I'm live runnin' around with him
Telling everybody hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up and check the clock
Punch it I go to work, I go to work
I go to work like an architect

I build a rhyme some times it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word

With each letter it becomes visably better
'Cause my foundation built a nation of rappers
And after I came off vacation I came to roam the land I own
And stand alone on the microphone daddy's home

Open the door playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the
Suckers in the place who run their face
The base and a taste of who's the ace

Start the race I'm coming in first
With each verse I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
After I got ya I have to slap ya

Senseless with endless rhymes don't pretend this
Is anything short of stupendous
And when this rhyme is done your mind will become
So trapped in the rap you'll lust on another one
You gotta wait it takes time

I don't write I build a rhyme
I draw plans draft the diagrams
An architect in effect and it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one

I go to work I go to work I go to work like a boxer
Train the brain and aim to out fox ya
Like a punch my rhyme knocks ya
Some times it rocks ya

So hard it stops ya dead in your tracks
So power packed before you can react
You're flat on your back down for the count
Get up and dismount 'cause I'm coming
With an endless amount of words in a hurry like a flurry

A collage to camouflage the power punch but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight
I wrote rhymes at a level so you can't relate unless you're intelligent

So stay awake sleepwalkers slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil

Rhymes in its highest form I'm a drop it on ya like a bomb
When it explodes I'll blow up a few casualties but so what
If you're slow you blow you know you go I flow
I throw all pro I go to work I go to work To say rap is not work

Is ludicrous whoever said it must be new to this
When you hear me you'll compare me to a prophet for profit not merely
Putting words together for recreation each rhyme's a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation, I get paid to rock the nation
I go to work, I go to work, I go to work",happy

I said come in, but respect my floor
that means take off your shoes and englands
'cause I'm a gentleman, some say distinguished
all of y'all put your things up in the kitchen
and the rest of y'all sit down and listen
be free and relax in what you're wearin'
let's all be happy like Bobby McFerrin
and get loose and produce the funky juice
and let's swing this shit like they swing a forty deuce
they want some reggae, like some flex
time to have sex
and it's all night, so turn off the light
and let's get high as a kite
and have safe sex

(Chorus)

somebody say sex (sex)
say safe sex (safe sex)
I love it (I love it)
I need it (I need it)

but for real, when you're havin' sex
no matter what type, make sure you wear the latex
to all of the cons out there sexin'
stop and look, boy, you're stressed out protection
cause aids is real and something to beleive
or not make-beleive and fake like hair weave
a death wish like Charles Bronson
and if you don't beleive me then ask Magic Johnson
about the sex

(Chorus)",happy

I want to shout, but I can't hardly speak

To a dancer friend of mine
I can't seem to stay in step

I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping

I'm zipping through the days at lightning speed
Plug in, flush out and fire the fuckin' feed
Heading for the overload
Splattered on the dirty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more

But I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming, (only get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping. (only get them off)

Feel so hypnotized, can't describe the scene
Its all mesmerized all that inside me
The sunshine bores the daylights out of me
Chasing shadows moonlight mystery
